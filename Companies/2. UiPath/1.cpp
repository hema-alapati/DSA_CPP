// Given an unrooted, unweighted tree of n nodes, traverse the tree from node 1 to node n. The path must go through nodes listed in the visitNodes array in any order.
// That is, the path
// • starts at node 1.
// • ends at node n.
// • can only travel from a node to an adjacent node.
// • can visit a node any number of times.
// • includes each of the nodes in visitNodes at least once.
// Return the length of the shortest of these paths.
